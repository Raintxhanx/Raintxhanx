# 👋 Hello World!! I'm Raihan Fathoni
or you can find me by the tag **@raintxhanx!**

I am a **beginner developer** currently diving into the world of **AI development**, **Object-Oriented Programming**, **and Data Analysis**, while actively contributing to open-source projects. My goal is to continually learn and grow in these fields every day.

In addition to programming, I have a strong interest in mathematics, science, and even music. I often create projects related to these topics, but my curiosity doesn't stop there—I'm always eager to explore new domains and broaden my horizons.
